## Description:
This is a brief analysis of Deere's SVA, with a particular focus on Europe,
which I wrote up having had a conversation with a erstwhile colleague and
friend from John Deere International.

The paper takes a high level view of the challenge of the European division of
Deere achieving the same level of SVA as the US operation.

I use a Debian system so I will presume that if your system is different you
can follow along from the Debian instructions.

You will require groff and grap:

`sudo apt-get	install groff grap`

You will also require a pdf viewer, I use both evince and zathura:

`sudo apt-get install zathura`

## Usage
To recreate the pdf *sav-jd.pdf* and view it from inside the directory where
you have downloaded the repo, you can simply type:

`. create-pdf; zathura sav-jd.pdf`
